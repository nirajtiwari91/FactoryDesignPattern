Factory Design Pattern in C#:

Definition:
The Factory Design Pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a super class, allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects created. It involves defining an interface or abstract class for creating objects, and concrete classes that implement this interface to create specific types of objects.

Uses:

Encapsulation:
Encapsulates the object creation logic, allowing changes to the creation process without affecting the client code.

Code Reusability:
Promotes code reuse by enabling the same creation logic to be used with different types of products.

Flexibility:
Provides flexibility in object creation, allowing the system to be easily extended with new types of objects.

Decoupling:
Reduces dependencies by decoupling the client code from the actual classes of objects being created.

Extensibility:
Supports the addition of new product types without modifying existing client code, making the system more extensible.

Centralized Configuration:
Facilitates centralized control and configuration of object creation, making it easier to manage and modify.

Testing:
Simplifies testing as the client code can be tested with different concrete implementations without changes to its structure.

Hierarchy Support:
Supports the creation of object hierarchies where the factory methods in subclasses produce objects that are part of a specific hierarchy.

The Factory Design Pattern is widely used in scenarios where object creation is complex, and the system needs to be flexible, extensible, and easy to maintain.
